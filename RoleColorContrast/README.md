# RoleColorContrast

A plugin to increase role color contrasts, by attempting to make them adhere to the WCAG AA or AAA guidelines (configurable).

## Compatibility

This is compatible with basic Themer themes, so long as they use dark mode and do not use transparency. Transparency support is entirely too difficult and so please don't ask.

## Adjusted UI elements
